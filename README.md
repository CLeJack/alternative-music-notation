# Alternative Music Notation
This repo contains documents that demonstrate two alternatives to western music notations

The alternatives are saved as svgs, and they can be viewed full screen by clicking the raw button in the top right hand corner of the preview window.

[Octave-staff.svg](https://github.com/CLeJack/alternative-music-notation/blob/main/octave-staff.svg) is very close to traditional western notation, and it only _slightly_ modifies the current concepts associated with staves and clefs to, hopefully, make sight reading simpler.

[Alpha-notation.svg](https://github.com/CLeJack/alternative-music-notation/blob/main/alpha-notation.svg) is a much more radical change that was meant to replace tracker software (Proto DAWs such as LSDJ), but as I was writing the idea down on paper, I realized it would be a good transcription tool.

The Alpha notation concept is incompleted. Compared to traditional notation, chords become slightly more complicated in how one might choose to represent them. For example:
- Notes could be stacked directly ontop of each other in a simple block chord like manner
- A separate line could be established with jazz-like chord-melody Annotations, with chord roots and slash chords representing the bass line and harmony of a piece
- Individual lines could be written to represent complex harmonic motion, polphony or voices; and when these lines are "stacked" on top of each other, they could represent a full harmony

In the above scenarios either efficiency of space is sacrificed, or expliciness is sacrificed when compared with traditional notation.
