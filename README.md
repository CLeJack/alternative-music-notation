# Alternative Music Notation
This repo contains documents that demonstrate two alternatives to western music notations

The alternatives are saved as svgs, and they can be viewed full screen by clicking the raw button in the top right hand corner of the github preview window or by using the links below.

[Octave-staff.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CLeJack/alternative-music-notation/main/octave-staff.svg) is very close to traditional western notation, and it only _slightly_ modifies the current concepts associated with staves and clefs to, hopefully, make sight reading easier. Its core benefits include notes always being on the same line or space, the removal of all other staves, and easier reading of ledger lines due to a new type of line called a "break line."

[Alpha-notation.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CLeJack/alternative-music-notation/main/alpha-notation.svg) is a much more radical change that was meant to replace tracker software (Proto DAWs such as LSDJ), not western notation, but as I was writing the idea down on paper, I realized it would be a good transcription tool. I include it as a "alternative to western music notation," but I think it would be more likely used in tandem with staff based notation if it is used at all.

The Alpha notation concept is incomplete. I chose not to formalize how harmony is represented, and there are currently a few ways to do it. For example:
- Notes could be stacked directly ontop of each other in a simple block chord like manner with little room for variation in duration
- Individual lines could be written to represent complex harmonic motion, polphony or voices; and when these lines are "stacked" on top of each other, they represent a complete musical thought
- A separate line could be established with jazz-like chord-melody annotations, with chord roots and slash chords representing the bass line and harmony of a piece

In the above scenarios either efficiency of space is sacrificed, or explicitness is sacrificed when compared with traditional notation.
