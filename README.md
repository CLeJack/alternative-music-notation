# Alternative Music Notation
This repo contains documents that demonstrate two alternatives to western music notations

The alternatives are saved as svgs, and they can be viewed full screen by clicking the raw button in the top right hand corner of the preview window.

octave-staff.svg is very close to traditional western notation, and it only _slightly_ modifies the current concepts associated with staves and clefs.

alpha-notation is a much more radical change that was not meant to replace tracker software (Proto DAWs such as LSDJ), but as I was writing the idea down on paper, I realized it would be a good transcription tool.
